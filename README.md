# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
my code when I started learning data structures and algorithms

## Binary tree
AVL tree + BST, sử dụng các nguyên lý của OOP
Insert node
Remove node
Balance tree every adding node
Check whether the tree is AVL tree or BST
BFS to print LevelOrder mode
DFS to travel tree
Find the "next" node of a given node (node - left - right, LNR, LRN)

## Graph
implement a graph using adj-matrix
DFS to travel graph
BFS to travel graph

## Hash Table
implement hash function
hash info

## Linked list
implement linked list
delete node
add node at tail

## Stack and Queue
implement stack and queue
implement 3 stack using an array (but the capacity of each stack is stable)
implement an algorithm that returns the min value of a stack. pop(), push(), min() take O(1) time

## Vector-Rebuild
just recreate vector library
